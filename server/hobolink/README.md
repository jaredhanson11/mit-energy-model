# Hobolink Weather

This directory contains all the scripts and data related to the building 1
station weather. It deals with downloading the weather data daily, and
updating an EPW file created for the MIT's Building 1.

## How to Use

__TODO:__ need to write documentation on how the files work in the this
directory and how to use them.
